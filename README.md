# GF2P2 Group 9
This project aims to simulate the behaviour of logic circuits, reading in a definition file in our custom language, then executing the logic network for given operational parameters: including simulation cycles, input states, and changing monitor points.

# Modules 
We begin with existing libraries for standard functionality, including the "devices", "network", "monitors", "userint", and "logsim" programs. Following a pre-defined structure, we plan to implement the "names", "scanner", "parse", and "gui" modules in sequence, designing the entire system first to ensure seamless communication between sections. Note that a majority of the simulation functionality is already written, and this project instead focuses on the design and processing of a logic description language as well as presenting the data in an easily-accessible way for users.
